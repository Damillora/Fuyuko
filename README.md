Node-based Gemini server running on gemini.nanao.moe

Currently uses [derhuerst's gemini Node.js library](https://github.com/derhuerst/gemini) for the 
Gemini protocol implementation. I added a basic file serving on top of it.

## Next plans

* Making the contents of my Internet blog available in Gemini via 
* Try to implement the Gemini protocol myself
* Create a router
